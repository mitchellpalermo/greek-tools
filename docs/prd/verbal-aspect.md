# PRD: Verbal Aspect Reference

## Overview

A focused reference page explaining Greek verbal aspect — one of the most conceptually challenging areas for intermediate students and poorly served by paradigm tables alone. Complements the Grammar Reference by explaining what verb forms *mean*, not just what they *look like*.

## Status

**Not started.**

## LOE

**Extra Small** (half day)

---

## Goals

- Fill the gap between paradigm tables (form recognition) and grammatical meaning (semantic function)
- Give students a concise, opinionated reference they can consult while reading
- Present one mainstream view clearly rather than surveying the academic debate

## Features

### 1. Aspect Overview

Brief explanation of the three aspects with Koine-specific framing.

**Content:**
- **Perfective** (aorist stem) — action viewed as a whole, without internal structure; the default "simple" aspect for narrating events
- **Imperfective** (present/imperfect stem) — action viewed as ongoing, in progress, or repeated
- **Stative** (perfect/pluperfect stem) — a state of affairs resulting from a prior action; "heightened current relevance"

### 2. Tense-Stem to Aspect Mapping

Quick-reference table: which tense-stem carries which aspect, and what temporal reference it typically conveys in the indicative vs. other moods.

| Stem | Aspect | Indicative: time ref | Non-indicative: time ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| Present | Imperfective | Present | None (aspect only) |
| Imperfect | Imperfective | Past | — (ind. only) |
| Aorist | Perfective | Past (usually) | None (aspect only) |
| Future | — | Future | — |
| Perfect | Stative | Present state | None |
| Pluperfect | Stative | Past state | — (ind. only) |

### 3. Key Distinctions

Short practical sections on the most common points of confusion:

- **Aorist vs. Imperfect in narrative** — aorist advances the story; imperfect provides background or description
- **Historical present** — present tense in narrative (usually imperfective, but used for vividness)
- **Aorist imperative vs. present imperative** — perfective (do this one action) vs. imperfective (keep doing / stop doing)
- **Perfect and its force** — not merely "past with present results" but a state of current relevance (e.g., γέγραπται "it stands written")

### 4. GNT Examples

2–3 short examples per section, with the key word highlighted. Each example links to the full passage in the GNT Reader.

## Technical Notes

- Entirely static content; no new data or components needed beyond the standard page layout
- Can live as a new section within `/grammar` (added to the nav sidebar) or as a standalone page at `/grammar/aspect`
- Adding it to the existing Grammar Reference sidebar nav is the lower-effort path

---

## Out of Scope

- Full discourse analysis or narrative theory
- Survey of the Fanning / Porter / Campbell debate — pick one mainstream position and present it clearly
- Classical Greek aspect (different from Koine in some respects)
